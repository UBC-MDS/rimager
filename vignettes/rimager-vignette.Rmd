# Overview

[`rimager`](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/rimager) is a R package that provides a quick and easy way to do image processings and graphic editings. The package includes four functionalities: reduce the size of the image, crop the image into a circle, reduce the image colors, and blur or sharpen the image. 


# Functions

## `circropper()`

## `reducize()`

## `imgfilter()`

## `reducolor(style, input_path, output_path = NULL)` 

Description: 

Reduce the image color to either 2 or 8 colors for cartoonized effect.  

Arguments:

`style`: integer, either 0 or 1 0 for white and black colors, 1 for 8 colors  
`input_path`: character, the image file path  
`output_path`: character, if not Null, the modified image will be saved in the provided folder path and name  


# Examples

We will use `mandrill.jpg` saved in the `images` folder of this repository.

![mandill.jpg](../images/mandrill.jpg)

## `circropper`

## `redusize`

## `imgfilter`

## `reducolor`
```{r }
#style 0, reduce the image color to white and black and save the new image mandrill_reducolor0.jpg in
#the images folder
mandrill_reducolor0 <- reducolor(0, "../images/mandrill.jpg", "../images/mandrill_reducolor0.jpg")
imageShow(mandrill_reducolor0)
```

```{r }
#style 1, reduce the image color to 8 colors. And because the output_path is NULL, the image will
#not be saved as a file.
mandrill_reducolor1 <- reducolor(1, input_path = "../images/mandrill.jpg", output_path = NULL)
imageShow(mandrill_reducolor1)
```
