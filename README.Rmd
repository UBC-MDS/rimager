## Overview

Want to edit an image in the shell instead of GUI applications? `rimager` is a R package that provides a quick and easy way to do some simple image processing and graphic editing. Based on the main needs of graphic editing, the package integrates four functionalities. The functionalities include: reducing the size of an image, cropping an image into a circle, reducing the number of colours in an image, and applying cool filter effects. By inputting the path of the image, users can run any of these functions with one line of code to get the desired image. This package was developed as a course project for DSCI-524 at the University of British Columbia.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("UBC-MDS/rimager")
```
### Dependencies

  - R 3.6.1 or greater
    - magick
    - plotrix
    - jpeg
    - OpenImageR
    
<span style="color:red"> Note: Because some operating systems (Ubuntu-16.04 '3.2', '3.3' '3.4' and macOs-devel) require older versions of packages (magick and plotrix) we used in development, we have excluded these OS in R-CMD-check.</span>


## Functions 

- `circropper`: This function crops the input image into a circle. This can be useful when you want to make icons from images. 
- `redusize`: This function reduces the dimension of a given image by removing vertical and horizontal seams.
- `imgfilter`: This function applies a filter to a given image, altering the visual aesthetic. This includes options to blur and sharpen the image with varying degrees of strength. This filter effect is achieved through the application of a matrix convolution with the filter kernel and original image. 
- `reducolor`: This function reduces the image colors to get the cartoonized color effect. This can be either white and black images or eight colors images.  


## Usage Examples

see [rimager-Vignette](https://ubc-mds.github.io/rimager/articles/rimager-vignette.html)  

## Our Package in the R Ecosystem

There are existing packages to process images. For example, both  [`magick`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magick/vignettes/intro.html) and [`imager`](https://dahtah.github.io/imager/imager.html) are popular packages that can be used to resize, cut images and apply filters. The goal of our package is to utilize these existing packages to improve the pre-existing functions or to re-implement the code manually. Additionally, it automates the image editing process, producing the altered image by one line of code.

## Package in python

We have a package with the same functionalities in python: [`pyimager`](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/pyimager)  

## Documentation
The official documentation is hosted on [pkgdown](https://ubc-mds.github.io/rimager/). You can also refer to the  [html vignette](https://ubc-mds.github.io/rimager/articles/rimager-vignette.html).
